I'd like to enter plan mode to thoroughly explore your codebase and design an implementation approach for making all content translatable. This will involve:

1. Understanding your current internationalization (i18n) setup
2. Identifying all hardcoded text that needs translation
3. Planning the translation key structure
4. Designing the implementation strategy

May I proceed with plan mode to analyze your codebase and create a comprehensive implementation plan?
